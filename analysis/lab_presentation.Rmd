```

- Analysis of a data set provided by Dr Aoife Coffee, UCC Library
- This experiment assessed the impact of UV over 21 days on plant growth and the accumulation of secondary metabolites
- Three varieties of lettuce
    - Cos Dixter, Skyphos, Red Oakleaf
    
- Three filter types employed
    - ca, my, ptp
    
- Plant samples taken at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks
    - For the first 7 days, no filter used
    - Plants were sampled without replacement
        - Same baseline used for each filter

# Initial analysis

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}

img <- readPNG("plots/2019-06-17_overview1_flavonoids.png")
 grid.raster(img)
 
```

# Initial analysis

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("plots/2019-06-17_overview2_flavonoids.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

# Initial analysis

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("plots/2019-06-18_biomass_overview.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

# Summary

- Relatively little change in flavonoid content during the first two weeks
- Spike in flavonoid content at week 3
- Cos Dixter flavonoid (ppm) content was highest of all three varieties
- Filter type had visiable impact on biomass
    - ptp > my > ca
